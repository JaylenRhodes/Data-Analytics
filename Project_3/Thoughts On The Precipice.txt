Thoughts on the precipice
How immense the universe is!
How eternal history is!
I wanted to measure the immensity with this puny five-foot body.
What authority has Horatio's philosophy?
The true nature of the whole creation.
Is in one word - "unfathomable".
With this regret, I am determined to die.
Standing on a rock on th top of a waterfall.
I have no anxiety.
I recognize for the first time.
Great pessimism is nothing but great optimism.
