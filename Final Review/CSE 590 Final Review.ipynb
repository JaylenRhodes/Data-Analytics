    "* The multiple choice portion is entirely closed book (taken through Respondus Browser) and primarily will assess your knowledge of major Python syntax, NLP, and Machine Learning libraries .  Sessions 22-27, 30-38 (and this review) are most pertinent for this portion.\n",
    "* The programming and analysis portion will consist of three major aspects: NLP processing of text, a simple supervised learning task, and some visualization of results."
